# Donut Chart Redesign - PROBLEM SOLVED! âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXACTLY What You Requested**

You said: *"I don't see these fonts to be bigger at all. I think that the problem is that the text is within the donut, that is unnecessary, there's a lot of space to have the text outside of the donut."*

**âœ… DELIVERED:** Text is now positioned outside the donuts using the abundant available space, making it much larger and more readable!

## ðŸ“Š **Before vs After Transformation**

- Text positioned outside donuts to the right
- 2-3x larger font sizes (32px-42px for key numbers)
- Efficient use of available space
- Clear, professional information layout
